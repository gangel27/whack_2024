Coventry City Football Club played 101 competitive matches away from home between the 12th September 2020
to 4th May 2024. If we assume that the minimum number of away fans that the championship require to 
be allowed to buy tickets went to those games (2000) and they all drove from the midpoint of coventry's
stadium to the midpoint of the opposing team's stadium, Coventry City's away games resulted in
34770468km being travelled. If we assume that the everyone drove in groups of 3 in cars that had 
average fuel efficiency for cars being driven in the UK (45 miles per gallon - 
https://www.swanswaygarages.com/blog/what-is-a-good-mpg-for-a-used-car-in-the-uk/), the team's
away game commuting has resulted in 258000 (257559.0 - 10.9kg of CO2 per gallon:

gallons of fuel being burned - emitting almost 3 million (2807393.1) kilograms of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This leads to increased
global average temperatures, rising sea levels and an increase in the rate of extreme weather events.
With climate change and general sustainability being global concerns in this modern age - with many
countries around the world aiming to be carbon-neutral by 2050 (https://climateactiontracker.org/global/cat-net-zero-target-evaluations/),
it would be suiting for a club thinking far into the future to try and get these numbers down. Possible
suggests include desginated bus fleet for fans of the clubs to get on to go to away games, or maybe the
introduction of a car-sharing platform for coventry city fans.

But we wanted to find out whether travelling for matches also affected the players as well...
