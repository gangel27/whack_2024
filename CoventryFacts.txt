Dumb Shiii I had to go through to get only as far as I've gotten
Manually finding the coordinates of every football stadium that coventry had to play at
Tried using the open-source map api openroute service but it complained that since I got the coordinates manually from
google maps for all 91 away games in the middle of the stadium, it complained that there were "no routable points
within 350m of the coordinates" I had provided and threw errors
Switched to the google maps distance matrix api and then had to divide the 1 origin and 91 destinations into
batches to get around the 10 origins, 10 destinations request limit
Now it finally appears to be working
