            <h1>Environmental Impact</h1>
            <p id="intro">Coventry City Football Club played 101 competitive matches away from home between the 12th September 2020
                to 4th May 2024. If we assume that the minimum number of away fans that the championship require to 
                be allowed to buy tickets, went to those games (2000) and that they all drove from the midpoint of CBA Arena
                to the midpoint of the opposing team's stadium, Coventry City's away games resulted in
                35 million kilometers being travelled. If we assume that everyone drove in groups of 3, in cars that had 
                average fuel efficiency for cars being driven in the UK
                (<a href="https://tinyurl.com/3x86hzev">45mpg</a>)
                , the team's away games have resulted in 260000 gallons of fuel being burned
                (<a href="https://www.carbonindependent.org/17.html">src</a>)
                gallons of fuel being burned - emitting almost 3 million kilograms of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This leads to higher
                global average temperatures, rising sea levels and an increase in the rate of extreme weather events.
                With climate change and sustainability in general being global concerns in the modern age,it would be 
                suiting for a forward-thinking club like Coventry City to get reduce these numbers. Possible
                suggestions are to employ a desginated bus fleet for fans of the clubs to go to away games, or maybe the
                development of a car-sharing platform for Coventry City fans.
            
                But we wanted to find out whether long commutes are unsustainable in other ways as well? such as the performance of
                the players. With the data provided to us, we've created graphs to visualise this argument.</p>

                <p>Personally, I always feel sluggish after a long journey, but as the graph to the right shows, a p
                    value that high for the product moment correlation coefficient means that there's no provable correlation.
                    And if there was, the PMCC value suggests that it would be in the opposite direction to what I was hyothesising!

                <h2>Does Commuting Affect Explosiveness?</h2>
                <p>I suppose that it makes sense that a finely tuned athlete doesn't temporarily lose fitness after riding a
                    coach. But maybe their muscles aren't quite as explosive, hence the graph to the right was created.
                    However, again we see no determinable correlation.

                <p>Phyiscally the players appear to be unaffected, but that doesn't mean that this also holds true for their
                    footballing ability. xG is generally considered a more accurate metric for how well a team played than
                    the result of the match as it averages out random chance/uncharacteristic error over a much larger
                    timespan/dataset. We stay defeated, with there being no certain degree of correlation.
                    Though a different trend has showed up on all of these graphs so far.

                <p>xG and goals both for and against frequently don't line up, be it because of random chance,
                    luck, or the immense pressure getting to players. What has preceded this in this
                    page showed that long commutes haven't bothered the players at all in any metric, but instinctive actions in either box
                    is so-far yet to be tested... the lowest correlation yet.</p>

                    average points per game from grounds with a distance of travel within
                    certain bounds, we do actually observe our first somewhat negative pmcc
                    value. Hooray we were right! oh never mind p it too high for it to mean
                    anything.

            <p id="outro">In Conclusion, the distance that the players need to
                traverse to get to the oppositions football ground has virtually
                no effect on any metric that we had access to. But this isn't to
                say our hypothesis was wrong however, as the data set is very limiting.
                There were only 101 away matches, and 46 opponents throughout the
                entire datya set and considering that the overwhelming majority
                of graphs had positive PMCCs all within 0.13 - 0.22, it can be said
                that the varying strengths and strategies of the teams being faced
                massively outweighs the effects that commuting a large distance can.
                But hopefully, and with the help of our data insights here, Coventry
                City Football Club will reach the heights of European Competition.
                When they do, we can revisit the data generated from the variety
                of new opponents to try to come to the bottom of the relationship between
                commute distance and many other football statistics.
